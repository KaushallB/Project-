# Bro-Code

Introduction to our project
Name: SirenSync

Description:
In the context of Kathmandu, where the response time of ambulances is very time-consuming since the numbers and details of the ambulance drivers are hard to search for  during emergency times. We the members of Bro Code have decided to work on a website that works on the concept of request and response.
How it works:
There is a form for a user and a different form for ambulance drivers. The different data from the filled-up forms are stored in the database. The main website is loaded and a popup box appears during an emergency. The users have to enter their location from the map and the list of nearby drivers appears immediately with their contact details. The user can directly contact the drivers, saving as much as lives possible.
People can also book doctors and healthcare personnel for onsite healthcare services
